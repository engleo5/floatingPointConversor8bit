# A Simple 8 bits decimal to binary converter

* Integer to binary converter
  * Fixed point representation.
  * Length of the binary representation is 8 bits.
  * Negative numbers in decimal are represented in one's complement.
* Floating point converter
  * Floating point representation.
  * Length of the binary representation is 8 bits.
    * 1 bit for signal
    * 3 bits for exponent
    * 4 bits for mantissa
      * First 1 of the mantissa is omitted to make the representation more compact. So the true lenght of the mantissa is 5 bits started by 1.

Using The Conversion Procedure Method to perform the conversion.[1](http://sandbox.mc.edu/~bennet/cs110/flt/ftod.html)
